I've been thinking a lot about personal growth lately. It's not always comfortable, and sometimes it feels like I'm moving backwards rather than forwards.

But I'm learning that growth isn't linear. Some days I feel confident and capable, other days I doubt everything. And that's okay.

What matters is that I keep showing up, keep trying, and keep being honest with myself about where I am and where I want to go.

Today's lesson: Be patient with yourself. Progress takes time.
