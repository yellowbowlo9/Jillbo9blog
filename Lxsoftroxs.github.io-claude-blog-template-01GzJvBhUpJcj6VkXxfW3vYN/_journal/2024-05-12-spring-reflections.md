Today was one of those perfect spring days where everything just felt right. The sun was warm, the breeze was gentle, and I finally felt like I could breathe again after the long winter.

I spent some time in the park, just sitting and observing. It's amazing how much you notice when you slow down:

- The way sunlight filters through new leaves
- Birds building their nests
- People walking their dogs, everyone seeming happier in the warm weather

These small moments of awareness are what I want to capture more of in my life.
