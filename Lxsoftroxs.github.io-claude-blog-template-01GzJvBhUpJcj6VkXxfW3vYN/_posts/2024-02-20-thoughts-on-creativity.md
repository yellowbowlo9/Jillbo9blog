Creativity is a fascinating thing. It flows when we least expect it and hides when we chase it too hard.

I've been thinking about how to cultivate more creative moments in my daily life. Here are some things that help:

- **Morning pages**: Writing freely without judgment
- **Nature walks**: Disconnecting from screens
- **Reading widely**: Exposing myself to different ideas
- **Creating without purpose**: Not every project needs a goal

What helps you stay creative?
