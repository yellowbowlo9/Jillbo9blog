- ✅ Change site title & description
- ✅ Upload images (drag and drop)

**NO code editing needed!**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Can't access /admin/"
- Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled (Step 1)
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling
- Try visiting your site first: https://yellowbowlo9.github.io

### "Login button doesn't work" or "Redirect loop"
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Click "Fork the repo" when prompted
- If you see a loop, clear your browser cache and try again
- Use an incognito/private browser window if issues persist

### "My changes aren't showing up"
- Wait 1-2 minutes (GitHub Pages needs to rebuild)
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Still having issues?
The new setup uses GitHub's built-in authentication (no external OAuth provider needed). If you're still having trouble, try:
1. Making sure you have write access to the repository
2. Checking that GitHub Pages is enabled and your site is live
3. Clearing all browser cookies and cache for your site
